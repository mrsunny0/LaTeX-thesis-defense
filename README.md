# TL;DR
The original **MIT LaTeX Thesis Template** can be found [here](http://web.mit.edu/thesis/tex/), and was last updated in 2012

The template provided here is a consolidated and organized version of the MIT template which complies with MIT's style and thesis submission guidelines. In this template, folders which contain documents to edit are:

*  [appendix](https://github.com/mrsunny0/LaTeX-thesis-defense/tree/master/appendix) : folder to add files for the Appendix
*  [bib](https://github.com/mrsunny0/LaTeX-thesis-defense/tree/master/bib): folder to add bibliography _.bib_ entries
* [chapters](https://github.com/mrsunny0/LaTeX-thesis-defense/tree/master/chapters): folder to add chapters, the main content of your thesis
* [figures](https://github.com/mrsunny0/LaTeX-thesis-defense/tree/master/figures): folder to add images and figures which you will include in your chapters (or other files). Use the command `\graphicspath{}` in the preamble to set paths to these figures to ease imports
* [main](https://github.com/mrsunny0/LaTeX-thesis-defense/tree/master/main): folder containing the overall style of the thesis (_mitthesis.cls_), title page, abstract, acknowledgements, signatures, and document preamble
* [tables](https://github.com/mrsunny0/LaTeX-thesis-defense/tree/master/tables): folder to add tables in _.tex_ documents which can be `\input`'d into your chapters (or other files).
