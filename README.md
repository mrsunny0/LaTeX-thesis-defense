# TL;DR
The original **MIT LaTeX Thesis Template** can be found [here](http://web.mit.edu/thesis/tex/), and was last updated in 2012

The template provided here is a consolidated and organized version of the MIT template which complies with MIT's style and thesis submission guidelines. In this template, parts of the thesis are segregated into folders:

* [appendix](https://github.com/mrsunny0/LaTeX-thesis-defense/tree/master/appendix) : subfiles for appendix A-Z
* [chapter 1 through 5](https://github.com/mrsunny0/LaTeX-thesis-defense/tree/master/chapter_1): each chapter folder contains content specific to each chapter
* [main](https://github.com/mrsunny0/LaTeX-thesis-defense/tree/master/main): the main folder contains the overall style of the thesis (_mitthesis.cls_), title page, abstract, acknowledgements, signatures, and document preamble. The final document will need to compile _main.tex_.

Within each chapter/appendix folder contains additional folders to segregate the bibliography, figures, and tables.

*  [_bib](https://github.com/mrsunny0/LaTeX-thesis-defense/tree/master/chapter_1/_bib): folder to manage bibliography entries (i.e. export from a reference manager such as Zotero).
* [_figures](https://github.com/mrsunny0/LaTeX-thesis-defense/tree/master/chapter_1/_figures): figures, plots, and illustrations should go in here. Use the command `\graphicspath{}` in the preamble (in _main.tex_) to set paths to these figures to avoid writing long relative paths.
* [_tables](https://github.com/mrsunny0/LaTeX-thesis-defense/tree/master/chapter_1/_tables): folder to add tables in _.tex_ documents which can be `\input`'d into your chapters (or other files).
